# godelbrot

## Summary

A sketchy mandelbrot viewer in Go

godelbrot has no dependencies outside of the go compiler, and its standard library.

## Usage

We hacked this thing up this afternoon, and haven't made it go-gettable yet.

To get started, clone this repository and then

    $ export GOPATH=/path/to/godelbrot
    $ cd /path/to/godelbrot
    $ go install functorama.com/demo/godelbrot
    $ bin/godelbrot
